It's crazy that there's a Wikipedia Page entitled _[Protocol on Blinding Laser Weapons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protocol_on_Blinding_Laser_Weapons)_.

Why is it so crazy? Because we choose to kill people rather than blind them.

Imagine if we started trying to blind our enemies. No torture, no pain! They arguably become a slight burden on their society, but it's _way_ better than orphaning a family.

I think we should start replacing bullets with lazers.
