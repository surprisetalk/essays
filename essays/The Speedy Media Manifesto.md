  --   Intent: The How & Why of Speedy Media
  --
  --   Arguments:
  --     - When consuming media, we want to maximize comprehension.
  --       - This is true when media is for information, or enjoyment, or both.
  --       - This is also true when consuming surreal or non-comprehensible art.
  --     - We want to maximize comprehension, but comprehension has diminishing returns.
  --       - In most cases, we shoot for 60%-85% comprehension.
  --       - In other words, "We shouldn't spend forever on a single piece of media".
  --       - Or in other other words, "The optimal comprehension rate is not 100%".
  --     - The easiest way to tune comprehension is to moderate speed.
  --       - Each type of media is unique in how it scales.
  --         - The major conflicts are visual vs. audio and speaking speed vs. listening.
  --       - Comprehension drops when the media is way too slow.
  --       - Comprehension is wasted when the media is slightly too slow.
  --       - Comprehension drops when the media is too fast.
  --     - Logarithmic learning, combined with the inverted-U-curve of speed gives us a nice little min/max equation.
  --       - ( Media difficulty, Personal comprehension rate, Target comprehension ) => Optimal consumption speed
  --       - e.g. ( Textbook, Moderate, 65% ) => 350WPM
  --       - e.g. ( "Neon Genesis Evangelion", High, 85% ) => 1.15X
  --       - e.g. ( 4TH Grade, 5TH Grade, 70% ) => 500WPM
  --
  --   Pitfalls:
  --     - Parallelizing media?
  --     - "But what about music?"
  --       - Passive vs. Active media
  --     - Effective media consumption is an entirely different topic.
  --       - But as a rule-of-thumb, "Go with the greats."
  --     - "But that's not how the artist intended..."
  --
  --   Media:
  --     Provide a calculator or interactive-graph for "optimal speed"!

## _TL;DR_

1. Media is fun and informational!
2. Speeding your media makes it _more_ fun and informational!
3. But speeding _too much_ makes it _less_ fun and informational!

# The Speedy Media Manifesto

You can literally watch every episode of _[Stranger Things (Season 1)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bb4uR9gTVXI)_ in [3 hours and 20 minutes](https://www.bingeclock.com/s/stranger-things/season/1/).

Yes, you can _literally_ watch a 400-minute series in 200 minutes. All you have to do is watch it faster!

But why would you want toâ€½

## In Search of Lost

> Pages follow the rhythm of hearts, not the rhythm of watches.

What's the duration of a 250-page book? To answer this question, you must first ask: _how much does the reader want to understand?_

Of course reading-speed depends on the difficulty of the text â€” 250 pages of J.K. Rowling is not 250 pages of James Joyce. But even _Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets_ may take 2 hours for a bright child, or 2 _weeks_ for a tired Literature student working on the 4th draft of a midterm project.

The duration of every book is tempered to our thirst for fun or information or whatever. Pages follow the rhythm of hearts, not the rhythm of watches.

Movies, podcasts, etc. naturally move at the rhythm of watches, but do they have to? What if we viewed 1X speed as a _recommendation_ than a _requirement_?

Rather than asking "how many hours will this media take?" â€” ask "how many hours does this media _deserve_?"

## 100% Comprehension

Consider the [Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginal_utility#Diminishing_marginal_utility):
> The law says, first, that the marginal utility of each homogenous unit decreases as the supply of units increases (and vice versa)....

Four pretzels does not make you 4X happier than one pretzel.
And [watching _Grown Ups 2_ 52 times](http://www.worstideaofalltime.com/about.html) does not make you 52X happier.

Drugs are valued by the experiences they evoke. MDMA makes you feel a certain amount of happiness for a certain amount of time. It's a simple matter of maximizing intensity and duration. If movies were like drugs (whose utility are the literal experience), then 4K would be _incredibly_ better than 1080p. But it's not. Reading a book on higher-quality paper is not _incredibly_ better. Watching a film in theaters is not _incredibly_ better than your laptop.

In the same way, watching one movie at half-speed _does not_ make the movie _twice_ as enjoyable.

The "utility" of media is the communication of its _ideas_. And _comprehension_ is the efficiency of idea transmission. Media can be used for entertainment or information, but it's not useful if the consumer doesn't understand what's being communicated.
But _comprehension_ is a sticky topic. For instance, take [this David Lynch short-film about rabbits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxKPBLjHAEA&t=1103s) â€” I may not comprehend Lynch's _intent_, but I certainly understand what I'm seeing. I certainly understand that there is a rabbit family in a family room, but I fail to grasp the deeper meaning of the film (if there is any). And I doubt that watching it slower or higher-resolution or louder would affect my understanding.
<!-- Also consider Tommy Wiseau's [The Room](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-dIdFXeFhs) â€” I'm not sure if anybody truly understands Wiseau's intent, but  -->
<!-- Consider the degrees of comprehension required to listen to an audiobook release of Rowling's *Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets*:
1. You can identify sound from non-sound. A rock cannot do this.
2. You identify that the sounds are attempting to communicate something. A moth cannot do this.
3. You identify that -->

In other words, _ideas_ are usually the important parts of films, podcasts, etc. (regardless of author or author's intent). And each additional minute you spend with an idea _up to a point_ will give you smaller and smaller amounts of value.

<!-- Comprehension studies -->

If it takes you 60 seconds to understand an essay with 45% comprehension, 60 minutes may only afford you 65% comprehension. And 60 hours would probably only get you up to 75% accuracy.

What if you were required to submit written exams as you left theaters? What level of comprehension do you think you would score for _Jurassic Park_? 
- Did you understand [the basic plot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurassic_Park)?
- Did you [notice what was written on the raptors](https://www.reddit.com/r/JurassicPark/comments/3ah37c/this_was_always_my_favorite_shot_in_jurassic_park/)?
- Did you understand the significance of [the seatbelt scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51Za8lQqgqs)?
- Did you understand [the contrasting plots of neophilia and ludditism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWz1E3oHd8w)?
The point is, everything has an infinite amount of detail, and it's okay to miss things. It's okay to comprehend 85% of _Jurassic Park_.

> Nobody aims for 100% comprehension.

The amount of time and effort required of a consumer does not scale linearly. On average, each additional second pored into a piece of media returns less and less.

<!-- TODO: Utility derived from a long, complex book will look like a shifted bell-curve, because it takes a while to understand the deeper ideas in the book. Plot utility vs. percent-complete. Surpass 100% completion as a way to communicate reviews. Give a few different examples of books and movies. -->

Why don't people spend their lives watching their favorite films on repeat? Because at some point, they get it. They get what the film was doing. They get what the film was trying to say, or what the film uniquely spoke to them. At some point, they heard the message and hung up the phone. And maybe months or years later they'll watch it again with brand new eyes.

## Comprehension and Control Theory

It takes [1.25 days](https://www.bingeclock.com/s/avatar-the-last-airbender/) (1830 minutes) to watch [Avatar: The Last Airbender](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1EnW4kn1kg) (a.k.a. ATLA) at the _recommended_ viewing speed.

ATLA is one of my treasures. I've watched the entire series 4-5 times (and will probably rewatch it again soon). I've committed more than 4 _days_ to this single piece of media, because it's just that important to me.

I love ATLA dearly, so why would I watch the series at double-speedâ€½ Here's my simplistic defense:
- My attention frequently drifts when I watch ATLA at the _recommended_ viewing speed.
- I enjoy ATLA more when my attention doesn't drift.
- My attention doesn't drift when I watch ATLA at ~1.75X.
- Therefore I enjoy ATLA _more_ at ~1.75X.

The following is true for most people in most situations:
<table>
  <thead>
    <th>
      <td>Speed</td>
      <td>Comprehension</td>
      <td>Engagement</td>
    </th>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>way too slow</td>
      <td>incomprehensible</td>
      <td>ðŸ’€</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>too slow</td>
      <td>lost comprehension</td>
      <td>ðŸ˜´</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>slightly slow</td>
      <td>inefficient comprehension</td>
      <td>ðŸ™„</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>perfect</td>
      <td>full comprehension</td>
      <td>ðŸ¤”</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>slightly fast</td>
      <td>lost comprehension</td>
      <td>ðŸ˜°</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>too fast</td>
      <td>incomprehensible</td>
      <td>ðŸ˜µ</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>way too fast</td>
      <td></td>
      <td>ðŸ¤¯</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

The key is staying *engaged*. It's about tuning the speed of incoming ideas to the speed of your mind. If the flow is too slow, you'll actually _lose_ comprehension due to distractions.

## Asymmetries of Understanding

So how inefficient is _recommended_ speed?

### Ears â‹™ Mouth

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>listening</td>
      <td>250-315 WPM</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>speaking</td>
      <td>140-180 WPM</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Humans can listen about _twice_ as fast as they can speak without loss of comprehenison.

- [Techniques, Perception, and Applications of Time-Compressed Speech](http://alumni.media.mit.edu/~barons/html/avios92.html)


### Eyes â‹™ Ears

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>reading</td>
      <td>300+ WPM</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>listening</td>
      <td>250-315 WPM</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Audiobooks are great, but they're not as efficient as books. We can read much faster than we can listen!

<!-- TODO: Research? Diagrams? -->

### Eyes â‹™ Hands

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>watching</td>
      <td>?</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>acting</td>
      <td>1X</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

We can understand movements and behaviors _much_ faster than we can perform them.

<!-- TODO: Research? Diagrams? -->

#### [Subs are Better than Dubs](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubbingVersusDubbing)

My top listening speed is ~350WPM, which means dialogue becomes unintelligble at 3X. But my top _reading_ speed is ~1100WPM, which means I can theoretically process subtitles at 7-8X.
In practice, video-comprehension (personally) starts plummeting at 4X speed. It is possible to keep up with simple stories, but trying to read 600WPM subtitles while watching the images flash by is no easy feat.

I'm not sure if I recommend moving to subtitles for speed purposes, but it definitely raises the speed limit for videos.

## The Scenic Route â‰  The Slow Route 

Every person and media forge a new experience together. Sometimes you want to savor every morsel of every frame. Sometimes you want to understand the bare minimum of the plot. Sometimes you want to skip around to the fight scenes.

Let's step through some hypotheticals:
- If savoring every second is what truly matters... 
  - ...are rollercoasters more fun at half-speed?
  - ...why wouldn't we spend more time on dessert than dinner?
  - ...why isn't [Porter Robinson's _Worlds_ (Slowed 800%)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vL4DQeRe_4) as enjoyable as the original?

Every experience has a sweet-spot on its speedometer.

<!-- TODO: We can trade quality for quantity. Skimming vs. dissecting. But diminishing returns... -->
