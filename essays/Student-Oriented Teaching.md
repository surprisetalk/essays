"Yeah, but why does that mean it's blue?"
"Uhh..."

The best part about questions-first learning is that you can ask people to _guess_, which is essential! By asking people to guess and listen to their internal models, you can instantly find and fix their faulty intuitions.

"Welcome to physics. Does anybody have any questions?"
"Why is the sky blue?"
"Why do you think it's blue?"
"Maybe because oxygen is blue?"

"Here's a picture of a beaker of oxygen. Any blueness?"
