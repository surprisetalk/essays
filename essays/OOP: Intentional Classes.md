<!--- Classes generally have one of three purposes:
----- * Storing data, e.g. Date
-----   * interfaces for encoding and decoding and operations
----- * Organizing data into structures, e.g. LinkedList
-----   * interfaces for reorganization
----- * Storing states with transitions, e.g. PurchaseOrder
-----   * interfaces for mutation
