<!-- TODO: Make a little pic of plugging an eth cable into a power socket. -->

So apparently you can buy [devices that transfer internet through your power sockets](https://www.amazon.com/NETGEAR-Powerline-Adapter-Ethernet-Passthrough/dp/B0778Y6K6N/ref=sr_1_4?keywords=ethernet+over+power&qid=1552256945&s=gateway&sr=8-4&tag=duc0c-20). That is, you can theoretically plug your modem into an electrical outlet downstairs, and then connect a computer to the internet through any electral outlet upstairs _without a wireless router_.

[According to Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power-line_communication), it's a well-known design called _Powerline Communication_. Neato!
