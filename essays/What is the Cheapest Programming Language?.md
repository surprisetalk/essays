# What is the Cheapest Programming Language?

Sorry for the click-baity title, but I was genuinely interested in the question when I started writing. But of course, things aren't that simple.

So let's start with a smaller question: how do programming languages incur costs?
- "easier" languages demand fewer man-hours
- "robust" languages demand less maintenance
- "lower" languages run more efficiently (i.e. at lower cost)
- "popular" languages attract cheaper labor
- "mature" languages reduce man-hours with libraries and tools

<!--

Explore each of these dimensions (and more?).

"easy": On time alone, it's cheaper upfront to develop in JS over C.
"robust": JS maybe "easier" than TS, but TS arguably has less maintenance cost because of the strict typing. You pay for time upfront to save time later.
"lower": C can be cheaper than JS because it can run more efficiently. And efficiency means cheaper hardware for products and cheaper servers.
"popular": What's the current salary for an APL programmer? Probably higher than JS.
"mature": Immature languages can have bugs, poor ecosystem, and broken/nonexistent tools.

"cheap/fast/good" should decide robustness, which forces the others.

cheapness by context:
- best for all cases whenever possible:
  - postgres
- best for non-hardware-intensive:
  - best for prototypes: vue, typescript
  - best for small teams: TODO
  - best for large teams: TODO
- best for somewhat hardware-intensive:
  - go
- best for very hardware-intensive:
  - rust
