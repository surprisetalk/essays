Master! Master! I'd like to quit smoking.
{: .student}

Oh really? And why is that?
{: .master}

Well, I think my blood pressure is too high, and I'm a bit worried about my health. Also, the lady-monks tell me I smell like garbage.
{: .student}

So why don't you quit?
{: .master}

Because I can't!
{: .student}

And why can't you?
{: .master}

Because I want a cigarette every few hours.
{: .student}

Well, that's quite the predicament, isn't it?
{: .master}

Yes! So how do I stop?
{: .student}

Hmm. Are you smoking right now?
{: .master}

No, but I want to.
{: .student}

Well why aren't you?
{: .master}

Because I don't want to.
{: .student}

You dunce! Which is it? Do you want to smoke or not?
{: .master}

Well I want a cigarette, but I also want to quit. And I guess I just want to quit more at this moment.
{: .student}

Okay well then it sounds like you've done it. Now go away!
{: .master}

But master, nothing has changed!
{: .student}

_The master punches the student in the face._

Ow! What the hell‽
{: .student}

You've already quit smoking!
{: .master}

No, but I want to _stay_ quit smoking!
{: .student}

Are you fucking stupid? Go away!
{: .master}

Master—
{: .student}

Eat shit! You can't control the future, you can only control what happens _right now_.
{: .master}

Yeah, but _right now_ I can increase the likelihood—
{: .student}

No you can't!
{: .master}

What do you mean I can't? Of course I can!
{: .student}

Then do it!
{: .master}

_..._
{: .student}

See? You're worthless!
{: .master}

But Master—
{: .student}

You can only not smoke _right now_. Let your future self worry about whether to smoke or not.
{: .master}

But I _know_ my future-self doesn't have the willpower—
{: .student}

Well then your future-self is fucked. Kick rocks, swine!
{: .master}

How do you get anything done—
{: .student}

Listen. I'm going to flip a coin. If it's heads, you're going to smoke a cigarette, if it's tails, you won't.
{: .master}

_The master flips the coin and grabs it out of the air, clutching it in his hand._

Now go away!
{: .master}

Wait! Is it heads or tails?
{: .student}

It doesn't matter! Go away!
{: .master}

You're so unhelpful! How about something practical? What about _[wei wu wei](#)_? Can't I find some way to _quit without quitting_?
{: .student}

Yeah, kill yourself.
{: .master}

Come on — what if I tried a nicotine patch?
{: .student}

Okay, sounds great. Go away.
{: .master}

But what if it doesn't work?
{: .student}

Then kill yourself.
{: .master}

Master!
{: .student}

Okay, you want to _quit without quitting_? Eat all of your cigarettes, right now.
{: .master}

Uh, won't I die if—
{: .student}

Eat every cigarette, one-by-one!

I'll die!
{: .student}

Yes, and you'll never smoke again!
{: .master}

Master!
{: .student}

Okay, fine. I'll tell you the secret: every time you want to smoke a cigarette, just do _the secret non-smoking ritual_ and you'll never have a cigarette again.
{: .master}

Really? That sounds incredible! What's the secret ritual?
{: .student}

Don't do it.
{: .master}

What? What do—
{: .student}

Every time you want to smoke a cigarette, don't smoke a cigarette. It balances out perfectly.
{: .master}

That's not a secret ritual! And besides, it requires too much willpower!
{: .student}

You fool! It only requires willpower if you want to smoke!
{: .master}

_Screams internally._ You're infuriating!
{: .student}

Okay, how about this: every time you want to smoke, fling every cigarette into the sea.
{: .master}

Every cigarette?
{: .student}

Yes.
{: .master}

Like every cigarette in the world?
{: .student}

Yes.
{: .master}

That's impossible!
{: .student}

Of course, everything in the future is impossible! You can only not smoke _right now_.
{: .master}

No, I mean, I can't do that to every cigarette _in the world_!
{: .student}

Oh well, fling all the ones within reach.
{: .master}

What if there is no sea?
{: .student}

Stomp them.
{: .master}

So everytime I want to smoke, stomp on every cigarette within reach?
{: .student}

Yes.
{: .master}

Hmmm. That sounds like it could work.
{: .student}

You sack of shit!
{: .master}

What?
{: .student}

It's impossible!
{: .master}

No, it seems pretty feasible. And kind of fun, to be honest.
{: .student}

You've just added extra steps.
{: .master}

Extra steps? To what?
{: .student}

Every time you want to smoke, you're going to not smoke. And then you're going stomp on all cigarettes within reach.
{: .master}

No, I'm going to stomp on them before I smoke them!
{: .student}

Okay, then do it.
{: .master}

_..._

Master...
{: .student}

Go away!
{: .master}

Okay, you're right — I can't do it.
{: .student}

Of course.
{: .master}

So what do I do?
{: .student}

Nothing. Go away.
{: .master}

But what if I smoke a cigarette?
{: .student}

I hope every cell in your lungs simultaneously burst into cancer.
{: .master}

Master!
{: .student}

It was heads.
{: .master}

_At that moment, the student was enlightened._
