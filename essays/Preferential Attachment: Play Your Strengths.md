> If you are interested in self-improvement, start by focussing first on goals where you have a head start. As you get better and better with that one goal you will likely be rewarded with more resources for it which you can use to get better at other things. 
> 
> For example, if you’ve been looking to exercise regularly and start saving money at the same time, try and focus initially on what you have an easier time following. 
> 
> Maybe, it is easy for you to hit the gym 5 times a week. 
> 
> And if you do, as a result you’ll soon build an appetite for healthier food options and you can start cutting junk food (by extension processed food & eating out) which will help you save money. 
> 
> You’ll also be spending time at the gym more so you might be able to cut down on entertainment costs that might have otherwise piled up.
