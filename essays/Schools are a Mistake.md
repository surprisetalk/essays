<!--

- Knowledge
  - Modern children primarily learn from other children.
    - Peers can't answer most questions.
    - Even worse, kids don't know anything, so they disseminate incorrect information.
- Social Skills
  - Kids nowadays don't learn to interact with adults.
    - The only reason "teenagers" exist is because adults and children have been stratified into two different realms.
    - Most kids copy other shitty kids, which creates monsters.
  - Kids don't learn how to take care of younger/weaker students.
    - In old one-room school houses, ages/grades were mixed.
- Engagement
  - Kids are forced to sit in classrooms where they're bored and unengaged.
    - It doesn't matter how good your teacher is -- learning is not a passive process.
- Standardization
  - Modern schools abhor uniqueness. Talent is squandered.
- Generalization
  - Many students just like 1 or 2 subjects. That's fine. Beyond reading and programming (specifically not math), every student should be allowed to min/max.
- Skills/Trades
  - Schools teach skills that are tangentially related to real jobs. But why not just teach trades directly? We should only focus on practical things, but then why would we need schools?
- Family
  - Schools allow families to drift apart.
- The Real World
  - Nobody takes tests in the real world. But we praise students who get good grades, even though it shouldn't be a metric for success. At work, the "right answer" matters a whole lot less than people skills. I'd much rather hire a likeable person who makes mistakes. Tests don't teach that.
  - Tests also don't teach shortcuts. Most "real" problem-solving skills are about finding solutions _that aren't on the test_. Like, your boss may ask you to take out the trash everyday, but also finding ways to generate less trash is a completely valid alternative that wouldn't score any points in the classroom.
  
- What would a perfect program look like?
