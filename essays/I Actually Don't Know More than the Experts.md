When studying MOND/Dark-Matter, I obviously favored the underdog.

"Of course Dark Matter is false! MOND is so much more elegant! Of course the universe favors elegant solutions."

One comment made me feel like an idiot: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23666387

Of course the experts know more than I do! They seriously tried MOND and failed! Soo Why was I so inclined to discount the expert opinions based on my intuition? My intuition is, by definition, not on par with experts' opinions.

In that moment, I actually felt like I understood anti-vaxxers, and other fringe groups.

There's something very alluring about (1) believing that you found a secret truth and (2) fear that the universe doesn't work the way you think it _should_.

* Dark-matter deniers want to live in an "elegant" universe. But the universe might not be elegant. Or, we might not have got to an elegant understanding of it yet!
* Anti-vaxxers want to live in a world where their children's illnesses are caused by "random" and "natural" disease transmission. But with decades of biochemistry, we can reduce total deaths by risking vaccine complications by "unnatural" causes.
* Anti-vaxxers also want to live in a world where "my body, my choice" doesn't have effects on other people. But we live in a world where not everybody can safely get vaccines, and every extra participant helps the whole.
