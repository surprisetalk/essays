# The Elegance of Single-Wheeled Vehicles

I'm surprised that there's not more single-wheeled vehicles out in the world.

Here are some things I like about things with one wheel:
- single point of contact with the ground
  - insane turning radius
- smaller number of parts
  - cheaper
  - easier to fix
- smaller
  - easier to carry
  - take up less space when parked/stored
  - can fit more easily in "primary" modes of transportation
- aesthetics
