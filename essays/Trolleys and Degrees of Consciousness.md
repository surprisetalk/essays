TODO: Make this a comic? Or series of images 

I'd like to eventually explore some variations of the trolley problem, as means of teasing out the value of consciousness:
- Trolley problem variant, where one track contains 1 fully conscious person, and other track has 5 brain-dead people with no chance of recovery.
- Next, consider persons whose hind-brains are working, but nothing else. They are only reflexive/reactive.
- Next, consider 5 "sleeping beauties" -- they are permanently sleeping, with occasional dreams. They are only reflexive/reactive.
- Next, consider 5 persons who are fully conscious, but have chronic, incurable pain. They are only reflexive/reactive.
- If the train was headed toward N cats, how large would N have to be in order for you to kill 1 human?
- If the train was headed toward 1 human, how small would N have to be in order to justify pulling the lever?
- Is there any amount of spiders that can be placed on the track to justify pulling the lever for a human?
