## Syntax is Hard

Think about how difficult it would be to make a compiler for C, Javascript, or Python.

When you're a beginner, every character is a trap.


```c
#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
  const char *names[3];
  names[0] = "Sally";
  names[1] = "Joe";
  names[2] = "Tommy";

  for(int i=0; i<3; ++i) {
    printf("%s\n", names[i]);
  }
}
```

```javascript
var names = ["Sally", "Joe", "Tommy"];
for(var i in names)
  console.log(names[i]);
```

```python
for name in ["Sally", "Joe", "Tommy"]:
    print(name)
```

Learning to program is _difficult_.

Imagine how many concepts need to be covered in order to write a for-loop in C:
```c
#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
  const char *names[3];
  names[0] = "Sally";
  names[1] = "Joe";
  names[2] = "Tommy";

  for(int i=0; i<3; ++i) {
    printf("%s\n", names[i]);
  }
}
```

Where do you even begin hereâ€½

It's slower to learn JavaScript alone than LISP _with_ JavaScript.

Yeah, seriously.

When you first start programming, _you_ are the compiler. A terrible, terrible compiler. You have to hold variables in _your_ memory. You have to remember every little syntactic nit-pick, because well, that's just how the language was written.
And when you're bad at compiling, you have to decode _error messages_. Stack traces are _not_ written for beginners.

```javascript
var names = ["Sally", "Joe", "Tommy"];
for(var i in names)
  console.log(names[i]);
```

```python
for name in ["Sally", "Joe", "Tommy"]:
  print(name)
```

And we wonder why students get discouraged by C++, Python, and JS.

Even in Python, there are so many symbols that _don't matter_ when you're just trying to _learn_.

<!--
Even for this _minimum_ Python example, a newcomer may ask the following questions:
- What does `for` {: .lang-python} do?
- How is `name` {: .lang-python} connected to `["Sally", "Joe", "Tommy"]` {: .lang-python}?
- What does `in` {: .lang-python} do?
- Why is each name wrapped in a double-quote, like `"Sally"` {: .lang-python}?
- What is `["Sally", "Joe", "Tommy"]` {: .lang-python}?
- Why are there commas?
- What does `print` {: .lang-python} do? What if I don't have a printer?
- What do the parentheses do in `print` {: .lang-python}?

<!-- TODO: it's not about quantity of characters! it's about quantity of concepts. how many rules do you need to know? how many things do you need to teach before the student can start simulating the system on their own? how guessable is the system? can you _guess_ how to do things? -->

<!-- TODO: look at SICP (link). holy crap they cover _way_ more ground than other programming courses. -->

<!-- 
the first thing in the parens is the recipe. the other things in the parens are the ingredients. to do something, just keep simplifying the parens until you're done simplifying

```
list	Return a list containing the arguments.
first	Return first letter of a word, or first word of a sentence.
rest	Return all but the first element of a list. 
cons	Prepend an element to a list.
nil/'() 
define	(Special form) Create a global name (for a procedure or other value).
equal?	Are the two arguments the same thing?
if	(Special form) Choose between two alternatives (see here).
lambda	(Special form) Create a new procedure (see Chapter \lambchop).
```
