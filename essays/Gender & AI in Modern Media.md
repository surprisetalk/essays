I think there are specific stereotypes for "male" and "female" AIs in television and movies.

I plan on going through the following lists to find some patterns:
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence_in_fiction
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_artificial_intelligence_films

Here are my first observations (in a personal shorthand, for now):
- female AI:
  - real fake meat: westworld, ghost in the shell, ex-machina
  - am i real hurr durr: westworld, ghost in the shell
  - is she real hurr durr: ex-machina, her
  - bad bitch: ex-machina, westworld
  - manipulative: ex-machina, glados, cortana?
  - pure: eve (wall-e)
  - servant: rosey (jetsons)
- male AI:
  - violent: joshua (war-games), i have no mouth, HAL9000
  - heroic: optimus prime, terminator, bladerunner
  - humorous: c3p0, marvin (hitchhiker's guide), wall-e
  - cold: data (star trek)
  - TODO: sonny (irobot)
  - servant: c3p0
