Why you should only go for easy-wins in life:
- the thing is easy
  - do the thing
    - in fact, when something is truly easy, you just do it
      - THIS is the goal
- the thing can be made easier
  - the thing seems difficult, but changing your abstraction makes the thing effortless
    - note again that when a thing is truly easy, you don't even notice it
- the thing can't be made easier
  - change your abstraction
  - let go of the thing

Never do anything hard. Just make things easier, or don't do the things.
