Los Angeles and Riverside are separated by a minimum of 90 minutes of suburbs and shopping centers. Taking the CA-60, suburbia is interrupted by hills peppered in weed-like plants. I'm reluctant to call the flora "weeds", because half are tree-sized and the other half are dead.

My pilgrimages to Riverside usually allot 240 minutes for phone-calls, listening, and aimless thought.
The human mouth is comfortable producing 150 English words-per-minute (WPM), but our ears can comprehend upwards of 500 WPM.
I usually listen to podcasts 2.0-2.5 times faster than they're recorded, which gives me 500 minutes (75,000 words) of podcasts on each round-trip. That's about eight podcast episodes or one whole book!

Today my podcast backlog seemed particularly unappealing. I didn't want to hear about ice-baths, or identity politics, or nootropics trends, or cryptocurrency, or crime drama, or whether a "Devil's Triangle" could conceivably refer to anything _but_ a MMF threesome.
Luckly, I have audiobooks on standby for emergencies like this.

I'm a huge fan of the gritty cyberpunk universes crafted by authors like Phillip K. Dick and Neal Stephenson. Books like Snowcrash consistently warp my views of capitalism, society, technology, drugs, and The Self.
So I guess it was finally time for "Distrust That Particular Flavor" by William Gibson, which is apparently not a novel -- it's an essay collection. I love essay collections! It was a surprise, but a welcome one.

Anyway, Gibson is a genius. And I don't use that word lightly.
These essays induced frission. These essays demanded quiet reflection. These essays will forever change the way I see Japan, writing, futurology, dystopias, and the internet.
But this rant is not about how amazing Gibson is -- it's about what we're losing in this golden-age of podcasts.

Some podcasts are just unprinted audiobooks with advertising. 
Stories like S-Town and The RFK Tapes take advantage of phone-interviews and historical audio, which doesn't translate to text or video very well. 
And series like Dan Carlin's Hardcore History have carved out a niche where books are too long and articles are too short. Carlin creates 4-hour masterpieces, recounting the past with fresh perspectives and a voice carrying conviction and emotion.
// TODO: In these audiobook-like podcasts, the creators use audio to forge arguments and information in a deeply satisfying way. It is a careful craft, like film and literature.

// TODO: episodic-podcasts, especially ones with guests, cannot possibly compete (depth-wise) with what singular people can expolre in long-form books
// TODO: they are off-the-cuff and poor means of truly exploring ideas
