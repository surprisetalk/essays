There are plenty of terrible designs that we've accepted because "that's just the way it is".

Here's a list of cool ideas that I want to explore:
- am vs fm (interesting story)
- ac vs dc (also interesting)
- querty vs dvorak
- nontyped languages
- eye/vision charts
- metric vs imperial
- public vs private transit
- belts vs suspenders
- alcohol vs everything else
- 13-month calendar
- nuclear vs everything else
- pi vs tau
- notations
  - math
  - music
- hyperpartisan politics
  - first-pass-the-post
- oses and the internet
  - smalltalk
  - minix
  - lisp
  - the web
- landscape vs portrait monitors
  - tv IS better in landscape because our eyes scan wide
  - and early comp monitors were tvs
  - but landscape is terrible for documents because reading is difficult
  - but it was okay at first beacuse it was only 80ish lines wide...
