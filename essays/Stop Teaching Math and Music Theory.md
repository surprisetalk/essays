You don't need to understand what an adjective is to speak to somebody.

You don't need to learn color theory to paint.

Humans are best at learning to do things first, and then abstracting the principles afterward.

When we do the opposite, students get discouraged.

* math: programming first, proofs after
* music: jam first, theory after
* language: speaking/writing first, grammar after
* painting: expression first, formality after
* history: stories first, dates after
* biology: nature first, vocab/diagrams after
* physics: engineering first, equations after
* chemistry: cooking first, atoms after

People learn best with context.
