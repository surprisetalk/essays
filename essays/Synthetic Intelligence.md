Can you spot the difference?
- "artificial" ⇒ "imitation"
- "synthetic" ⇒ "man-made"

An _artificial_ diamond is something like [cubic zirconia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubic_zirconia). It's not a diamond — it's not even carbon — but can still serve as an appropriate substitute for an engagement ring.
A [_synthetic_ diamond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_diamond) is simply created in a lab. It's real, genuine carbon, but it wasn't created by pressure from the Earth's crust and mined under questionable conditions.

It may not seem like a big deal, but whether or not we consider something an "imitation" has _huge_ moral and legal repurcussions.
