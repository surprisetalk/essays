> Michelangelo was asked by the pope about the secret of his genius, particularly in regards to the statue of David, largely considered to be the greatest sculpting masterpiece of all time. Michelangelo responded by saying, “It’s simple. I just remove everything that isn't David.”

I want to become recklessly kind. I want to become healthy enough to meet my great-great-grandchildren. I want to become disciplined. I want to become prolific and charasmatic and full-of-wonder.
But I'm not these things. And I'm often disappointed because I'm not these things.

_Who I Want To Be_ abhors _Who I Actually Am_.

Okay, okay — enough with the sadboi poetry 💀

<!-- It's common wisdom to "be yourself". But it's also advised to "not be a bad person". But what if you're a bad person? Are you supposed to be yourself or not be a bad person? -->

"Finding Yourself" is not like molding clay. Your mind is not malleable — it's resistant to change. _Who You Actually Are_ cannot easily flex and twist into _Who You Want To Be_.

<!-- things that are not a part of me that I want to be a part of me -->

But _Who You Actually Are_ is sculptable. You can decide that "That Ain't Me". You can chip away at imperfections. You can slowly smooth out rough edges.

So how do you find yourself? It's simple. Just remove everything that isn't _You_.

<!-- things that are a part of me that I don't want to be a part of me -->
