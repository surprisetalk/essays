What are some unique VR applications?

# Film Theory for Virtual Reality

Serious cinema really hasn't been explored for VR. What are our options?

## Static

Let's start talking about static shots. What's possible?

It's actually just a series of transforms in a space, in relation to an observer! Describe the linear and nonlinear transformations for each of these.

### Aspect Ratios

Is there action happening "behind your head"? Can you turn around and see it?

Can you move your head in 3-space, or only tilt it? If so, then that makes a lot of the stuff below more complicated.

### Position and Direction

Given one or more objects in a space, from what positions and directions can we capture all targets?

What feelings do the spatial relationships evoke?

Does the 180 rule apply?

What about tilt?

### Zoom

Zoom isn't possible, or is it?

You can expand the center of the spectator's vision and shrink the periphery to create a zoom.

### Depth-of-Field

What do "VR lenses" look like at different DoF?

### Depth Perception

We can do a lot of weird stuff with depth-perception!

For instance, while maintaining the same image, we can invert the depth so that the world seems to be coming "out" at you where it shouldn't.

<!-- TODO: This would make for a really good webpage with graphics that can be viewed with the red/blue glasses, or something. Or maybe a VR essay? -->

## Dynamic

What happens when we vary our position and transformations over time?

## Interdynamic

What happens when we link dynamic shots together?
