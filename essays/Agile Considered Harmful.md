(Alternatively: Why Waterfall Still Beats Agile)

# Thesis
- Upfront design and planning and batching reduce maintenance (and maintenance is costly). Agile pushes design/planning to the implementation phases. This is bad.

# Arguments
- Anecdote: doctors vs. car mechanics -- building things while the engine is running.
  - Agile is specifically designed for building systems while the engine running.
- Would agile work for building homes? Building spaceships? If not, why should we expect it to build durable software?

# Potential Solutions
- Make the product backlog immutable -- any additional features have to occur in subsequent versions of the product.
  - Product versions are treated as completely different codebases.
