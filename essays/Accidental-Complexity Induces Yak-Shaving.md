# Accidental-Complexity Induces Yak-Shaving

> "Hey dude, why is your ex-girlfriend cleaning my bathroom?"

> "Oh, because her dogs are too loud."

This is a true story.

My ex-girlfriend is pursuing a graduate degree in journalism at USC (so proud of her!). She was trying to write her final essay for Winter semester, but the dogs at her parents' home are loud and distracting. So she asked me if she could hang out in my quiet apartment while I was at work. After visiting the gym, she arrives at our place to shower and write, but unfortunately, our main bathroom light was not working, so she opted to use my roommate's personal bathroom instead. But his dirty-boy-bathroom was not up to her standards. And so when my roommate got home, he found somebody cleaning his bathroom. Because she needed to write an essay. Because her dogs were too loud. Classic.

> You see, yak shaving is what you are doing when you're doing some stupid, fiddly little task that bears no obvious relationship to what you're supposed to be working on, but yet a chain of twelve causal relations links what you're doing to the original meta-task.

I want to stress that yak-shaving has _nothing_ to do with distractions. Yak-shaving is all about _necessary_ sub-goals that lead you far away from the original goal.

Yak-shaving is fundamentally caused by _prediction-friction_. When expectations fail, we reroute reality to meet our false predictions.

Expectations fail due to lack of information (in the information-theoretic sense).

- entropy
- lack of knowledge

## Entropy

## Difficulty


<!--

bad design _induces_ yak-shaving

- "incidental difficulty"

- accidental complexity due to difficulty
  - time wasted due to duration of activity
  - time wasted due to retries
  - time wasted due to damage-control
  
accidental-complexity also occurs due to _coupling_. screws are _dependent_ on screwdrivers, so anything with screws is dependent upon an available screwdriver. two ways to fix possibly address this are (1) use hand/coin screws or (2) build a screwdriver into the object so that they're always local. but both of these can increase cost, and we all know jobs themselves are just yak-shaving for obtaining money for the dreams we don't have enough time to pursue.
  
identifying accidental complexity is difficult because it _feels_ like a natural part of the process, and people are resistant to changing habits
