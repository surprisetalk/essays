Wealth

=========================================================

There’s no sympathy for the rich.

As a child, you don’t care about money unless you have too little. Money is not about status, but rather this magical substance that generates toys and food. All things derive meaning from your immediate experiences, without the larger social picture attached. Poor kids and brown kids are all potential friends until they bite you or something. 

But age shows us that being rich is a good thing, and being poor is a bad thing. The wealthy get to have more fun because they have more of this money stuff. Some learn that too little money obstructs them from school, or girlfriends, or being an artist, or general happiness.

This inequality is rationalized very differently.

To those that believe money is a little luck and a lot of hard work, then the wealth gap is fine. But by placing value in hard work — in equal opportunity —  you’re reducing your life to employee’s hours. If your life lasted X hours at Y dollars an hour, then you’re worth Z dollars. It’s hard not harbor feelings of greed and jealousy in a mindset like that.

To others, money is a natural resource that is misallocated, therefore the wealth gap is not okay. By placing value in equality, you seek to quell injustice. And differences in wealth are an obvious opponent of justice when equal quantity is a desirable metric in your worldview. How can you not hate the wealthy in this system?

And so we see that both sides of the spectrum have reasons to hate wealthy people. Conservatives breed disdain through competition, and liberals view it as an evil to be stopped. 

=========================================================

Growing up rich was awesome. My basic needs were satisfied all the time. I had family that loved me. We got to go on plenty of trips. I got a great education. Blah blah blah.

But at a certain age, some realize they have it better than everybody they know, and that this has to be a secret, lest their pride consume them or others' jealousy destroy them. They realize that those who fail to keep their wealth a secret — even if they’re donating millions to charity — are hated because of their class. People frequently describe who actually deserves the money that the wealthy are receiving. This money should go to education, or military, or Ethiopians. They learn that people do a weird mix of sneering and ogling when they see expensive sports cars.

Every few years I would develop friendships deep enough to open up — to show that I had a rich family. I didn’t keep it secret because my family is greedy, or mean, or selfish; nor did I keep it a secret because I was humble. I hid my wealth because it was the smart thing to do.

The best thing about being rich is that I know how meaningless money can be. 

When you receive a scoop of ice cream you’re content. When you receive a bowl of ice cream, you’re happy. When you receive a tub of ice cream you’re a bit happier. When you receive a truckload of ice cream, you’re a bit happier.

Money means a lot when you’re poor, but additional income after a certain point loses its meaning. There’s only so much satisfaction one can derive from things and experiences. It doesn’t scale linearly.
