I am a Shitty Person

How does one be completely honest with oneself? I'm letting my fingers type freely, trying to come to terms with the fact that I am one of the shitty people on this planet. It's not just like I do bad things from time to time; I am a genuinely bad person with a rotten core. I feel like one of the antagonists on a movie -- those jerks where you just wonder how they got that way, and no explanation is ever given. And it's not like I have an excuse for why I am shitty! My parents are loving, I've never experienced trauma, I'm in good health, I'm blessed with good qualities, and yet I'm just a total dickhead. How does one become this way?
The worst part is that this realization is temporary. I'm going to wake up tomorrow and give not a single semblance of a consideration to the fact, not opinion, that I am a shitty person. I will live my life oblivious to the fact that I am making people's lives shittier just by existing.
I realize that I've rambled on about 'why's and 'how's but no 'what's. First of all, I am totally sexist. I don't think one gender is better than the other, but I treat (cute) women with much more preference than average people. Actually, I am nicer to popular and attractive people in general. Sometimes it feels like the only reason I'm alive is to make meaningless relationships with people that I'm only casually interested in. I will earn the unhappiness I deserve. Second of all, I usually think I'm 'the shit' rather than 'shit' which I can see now that I truly am. I generally believe that I am somewhat attractive, pretty smart, and decently nice, but tonight I've realized that I'm somewhat ugly, dumb in most areas, and totally shitty. There's so many more, but I'm too tired to continue.

I suppose what prompted all of this is that I met a cute girl today, who kindly invited me over for pie. The only reason I stayed around is because, you know, I'm lonely and desperate to some degree. Looking back, I don't know people like her put up with my shit. Like literally, I said so many offensive things that were only realized in retrospect. Like why do I have any friends? All I do is talk about myself. God I am such a fuck-up. Some guy came and started talking about his mom's death and his divorce, and you know what, I cared deeply for him. But at the same time I was a bit pissed because he stopped the flow of fun for everybody that gathered around. Like how fucked-up of me to actually internally bitch about somebody divulging their heartbreak. 

How does one fix one's own personality? How does one unshit their soul? I don't know. I hope this is something fixable. I hope it's not one of those things that I'm stuck with for good, or that will take an indefinite amount of time to fix. I'm thinking about internally declaring temporary celibacy. I feel like the pursual of women is what makes me generally shitty. If I treated women, and all other persons, equally and compassionately, my life would be a lot better. And it's funny that I say "my life" because that's the exact opposite of what I should be thinking about; I should be thinking about the needs of others rather than my own wants.

I want to be a less shitty person but I honestly don't know how.
