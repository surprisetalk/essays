<!---- * The Pitfalls of Linear Reading (BUG: I don't particularly like this list yet)
------   * For larger works, it's impossible to hold the entire text in your head
------   * You don't know _why_ something is relevant until after you've already forgotten it
------   * It's easy to get stuck on difficult concepts that are illuminated later
------   * You forget _why_ you want to learn the information in the first place
------   * You trick yourself into thinking you know more than you actually do
------   * It's ADHD-friendly

------ * Modified Feynmann Method?

------ * Integrate questions from the book!

## TL;DR

For one or more non-fiction texts:
1. Write down any questions you have about the text.
2. Open the text.
3. _Skim the full text_ until it becomes gibberish.
4. Close the text.
5. Answer as many questions as you can.
6. If any questions remain, repeat steps 1 through 5.
