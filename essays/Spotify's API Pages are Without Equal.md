# A Focus on Examples

It's really nice to have a little interface that produces real-life text.

Plus, notice the button that autofills samples! Sometimes docs say things like `date`, but it's unclear _how_ they want their date formatted.

Best of all, you can copy-and-paste it! Every API doc should have at least one example.

# Easy Authentication & Permissions

Authentication is often the biggest hassle of integrating an application.

Not only do they make it easy to generate a client ID, but they have a nice little check-box system to make sure that you've selected a sane scope.

# Just Do It

Lastly, why shouldn't you be able to play with the interface from the docs? I don't want to rewrite bootstrap code in my target system just to see how the dang thing works!

Plus, _it shows you output data_. This is _huge_. One of the hardest parts about integrations is that you don't know what to expect! It's wonderful being able to play around with results in their environment, where I have a narrow range of things that can go wrong.

With an interface that can quickly produce outputs, I can compare against the code in my target environment! This is such a breath-of-fresh-air.
