When I got married, I gained 30 lbs. When I asked my wife to stop cooking for me, I immediately lost 5 lbs. That's because I naturally have a good taste for healthy foods. Eating nutritious foods is not a "diet" or "habit" or "lifestyle" -- it's just what I do 'cause I accidentally like nutritious foods.

In the past few months, I've been thinking a lot about finances. I want to live in a house. And I want that house to be somewhere safe. And I want my future children to live comfortably. But I also don't want to toil on crappy websites until I'm 73. I don't want to spend the best years of my life earning money for other people.
Long story short -- I started taking finances seriously. I stopped spending money on junk. I started investing. I started researching the stock market. Short-term rentals. Startup ideas.
And suddenly finance is not scary anymore. In fact, I suddenly _like_ it, which is weird. Finances were yucky, but now they're tasty.

I put a lot of work into my media consumption. I listen to noise like Trout Mask Replica and Clown Core. And watch unwatchable David Lynch films. I read unreable works like Infinite Jest and Gödel/Escher/Bach. Because I crave the reassurance that I'm not "as dumb as everybody else"™. I feel some need to digest difficult media because I want "good taste". And in turn, this pursuit of "good taste" in media has taken me to while places! And taught me so many things. And I'm very grateful that I have usually have a pretty good media diet.

TODO: replace the paragraph above with how I naturally feel like I have a good "media diet" just like my actual diet

My wife and I have been "critically" cooking lately, and it's a lot of fun. I'm starting to develop a "taste" for food. And from the pursuit of "good taste", I've started learning about salt and flour and acid and broiling and bone broth and so on. And it cost absolutely nothing to start enthusiastically participating in an inescapable activity like cooking.

I want to develop a "good taste" for fitness. I want to treat fitness like I treat food and music and movies and books. I want to want to want to want to experience fitness. And I don't want it to be hard work. Because crazed, unreadable books like House of Leaves and Infinite Jest weren't work to me. Rather than "uphill" hikes, they were giant forests with secrets waiting in the canopies. It wasn't body-flailing -- it was dance.

And not just fitness. I want to have "good taste" for time. I want to recursively hone my sense of taste. I want my ability to choose "what's next" every moment to be just as good as my ability to choose "what's next" with every television series. 

And not just time. I want to have "good taste" for life. I want "what's next" to be just as good as "what's far in the future".

I want to want all this, so how do I get there? Maybe this moment of awareness is all it takes. Maybe just realizing that "good taste" is possible will be enough for me. Or maybe I'll continue to view the pursuit of "good taste" as too much work. We'll see.
