# My Daily Routine

<!-- ![Benjamin Franklin's Daily Routine](https://dw8stlw9qt0iz.cloudfront.net/IG8P7fErIdd5T7Y-eLijaa--cCg=/fit-in/675x799/filters:format(jpeg):quality(75)/curiosity-data.s3.amazonaws.com/images/content/portrait/standard/bc021863-2e1b-4ba5-e624-2d93b21f9ac9.png) -->

There are a bunch of things I want to do _everyday_. The actual time-of-day (e.g. 5AM) is not as important as the overarching sequence. I tried to order/group my subroutines something like the following:
1. Be Happy
2. Be Healthy
3. Make a Gameplan
4. Make Dope Shit
5. Make Shit Dope
6. Garbage In · Garbage Forever

First of all, it's important to start the day off full of joy. Otherwise, what's the point? An unhappy life is an unsuccessful life. And more importantly, nobody intentionally sticks to routines that makes them unhappy.

And once my spirit is charged, it's time to take care of my body. Basic fuel/exercise/hygiene improves mood, intelligence, longevity, and attractiveness. It's going to make _everything else_ easier.

After my spirit and body are acknowledged, it's time to do everything else. First, it's important to reflect on _what I actually want to do_. I try to prioritize tasks based on what takes the most brainpower: learning, then creativity, then chores, then media. Learning and creating are difficult after a long day's work, so I try to get it done before I expend willpower on tedium. I use procastination to my advantage — [Parkinson's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law) forces me to work smarter, not harder.
