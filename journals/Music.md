I want to do a music exploration soon! I love diving into the depths of The Internet to find tunes.

Drum Corps seems a bit silly from the outside. I mean, it's impressive in its scope, but it's definitely not my cup-of-tea.

Anyway, I just wanted to make a mental note of the music composition in these pieces -- SO HYPE. I'm totally going to steal some of the melody and rhythms for my own music!

The part from [2:45](https://youtu.be/X4GMf43z_vc?t=165) to [3:27](https://youtu.be/X4GMf43z_vc?t=210) is incredible! That glide effect mixes so beautifully with those giant jazz chords!
