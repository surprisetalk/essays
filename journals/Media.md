I just found an amazing subreddit called [cursed_images](https://www.reddit.com/r/cursedimages)!

Here are some highlights:

I'm almost finished listening to _The Rise and Fall of the Dinosaurs_.

I want to do a recap/review when I'm finished, but for now, all I can say is "whoa".

I spend a lot of time watching "interesting" things and listening to other people's opinons.

How do I escape the endless trap of browsing the internet to say, "oh, that's pretty cool"? 

And like, why do I care so much about others' opinions? You wouldn't believe how many hours I've spent watching anime analyses. Why does it matter? Why do I care?

I'd like to rid myself of these desires, but I don't know how.

I'll be posting stuff about my media consumption here.

I plan to do reviews of things, along with my general thoughts about media consumption.
