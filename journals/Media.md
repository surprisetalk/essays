I'm almost finished watching [Planet With](http://www.crunchyroll.com/planet-with).

I can say, with confidence, that this series is largest difference in quality I've ever seen between a story and its cinematography. This show has a unique and thought-provoking premise with animation that is _utter garbage_. The CGI is horrendous and most of the robots are super lame.

But once again, its story is actually quite interesting if you can stomach the animation.

Maybe I'll do a more in-depth review later!

I found some lectures I wanted to download and used the following script to download them all:
```bash
youtube-dl -i $(lynx -listonly -nonumbers -dump http://cufp.org/videos/)
```

Computers are amazing, aren't they?

I'm almost finished listening to _The Rise and Fall of the Dinosaurs_.

I want to do a recap/review when I'm finished, but for now, all I can say is "whoa".

## 2018/09/17 1853h

I spend a lot of time watching "interesting" things and listening to other people's opinons.

How do I escape the endless trap of browsing the internet to say, "oh, that's pretty cool"? 

And like, why do I care so much about others' opinions? You wouldn't believe how many hours I've spent watching anime analyses. Why does it matter? Why do I care?

I'd like to rid myself of these desires, but I don't know how.

I'll be posting stuff about my media consumption here.

I plan to do reviews of things, along with my general thoughts about media consumption.
