## Personal Experiences with Soylent

Soylent is rad.

If you're on the soylent train, don't overdo it.

If you're not on the soylent train, come aboard! Just make sure to drink it _before_ you get hungry.

## Soylent for Emergencies

Soylent's "nutritional density" (for transport), low cost, and ease-of-preparation make it a perfect candidate for soldiers, disasters, and remote locations.
