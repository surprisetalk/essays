A young girl's quest to learn magic from the Seven Sages (each a different programming language).

It's a magical world where nature (big twist -- they're living in a simulation) responds to magic as programming languages.

Set up problems to solve (graph theory, etc.) via the world around them.

Magic is both used for building stuff in the world and "battle". Think of rules for programming battles.

Universities only teach procedural magic (C++, Python, etc.), but the main character can't afford to go to those universities. Her rival/friend ends up becoming a god of C++ at wizarding school, and she resorts to taking a job from an old eccentric who happens to know lisp (surprise -- he's one of the seven sages).

All interactions are done through network requests, so we have to teach networking, etc.
