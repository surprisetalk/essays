- meat as objects of status (pop stars):

- talk about how meat's nutrients get absorbed into the soil

- children and ghosts would be good characters

- mechanics of bodies
  - meat that sees
  - meat that thinks
  - meat that feels
  - meat that tastes
  - meat that talks
  - meat that swims
  - meat that breathes
  - meat that beats

- college dorm
  - ""Dormitory" is derived from the French "dormir". And wherever there's sleeping, there's a whole lot of fucking. And Beth's back fucking hurt. And Paul's cock was getting limp.
  - This arc is about meat's reproduction and death.
    - It's "meat" as looking at women like objects.
  - Surprise! It's actually nursing home!
    - The "classes" they were going to were pottery and jazzercize.

- prison
  - An inmate is trying to escape prison without revealing that he's actually a super-genius.
  - Surprise! It's actually a pound where they're doing intelligence experiments on dogs.
  - This arc is about meat's utility and intelligence properties.
    - It's "meat" as using animals as pets, transportation, farming, food, and experimentation.

- TODO
  - I wanted to do a double-twist where you start to think it's a crazy person in an asylum who thinks it's a governmental experiment facility. But it's actually a sane person and it is a experimental facility. It's just that he's the only non-homeless person there. And they're making super soldiers like Captain America (meat as strength/labor/violence).
  - This arc is about money, work, hunger, and value.
    - It's the "meat" as stepping over homeless people on the sidewalk.

- the knot: how all the stories come together
  - 

All three arcs communicate that all meat is worthwhile and should be respected: animals, homeless, etc., i.e. don't waste meat.

---

- Samson's arc
  - Samson must overcome the weight of his own intelligence to find happiness. He was a happy dog when he didn't know anything. Now he's smarter than most humans and he views them as animals -- he learns to understand the animal/human relationship. "Man's best friend" vs. "Man's worst enemy". He would make a good super-villian for the story.
- Nancy's arc
  - Nancy used to be a dancer. In her story, she must learn to let go of her beauty and embrace the return to the soil. Her story starts out with a vampire/werewolf dilemma where she can't decide if she wants the "good boy" who is one of her peers or the "bad boy" pastor. After she dies, tell her life story (maybe she's Camille's mother?). Maybe she lived on a farm (animals as meat) and wanted to be famous (object of desire) and live in the city (small apartments as "coops") but her parents were conservative Christians, which is why she in so interested in Michael?
- Michael's arc
  - Michael is a SDA pastor. In his arc, he fights his "desires of the flesh" and eventually accepts that he is 100% meat and 0% soul. He first must overcome SDA vegetarianism, and then women as pastors (Nancy challenges him, and makes him unsure that women are unworthy of pastoral duties), and then his own desires of the flesh (fellatio from Nancy while visiting the nursing home), and then wrestle with Jesus as Flesh (Nancy dies). Nancy dies holding her breath while sucking the pastor's dick, and fucking her lifeless skull "feels amazing" until he realizes what happens; this forces him to accept sex and death all at the same time.
- Camille's arc
  - In Camille's arc, she must overcome her own weakness (monetary, physical, and emotional) and then realize not to exercise dominion after she finds limitless strength. Camille made a fortune as a biochemist by fixing all the problems with lab-grown meat. Before her magnum-opus research was finished, the meat industry started sending hitmen after her to prevent it from being published. She decided to hide in a psych-ward for a while (HIPPA makes you unsearchable), and now they won't let her out because they think she's crazy. They ship her off to a government testing facility to make super soldiers, where she meets Samson and devises an escape. It would be really cool if she fixes the super-soldier formula and injects it into herself and Samson to defeat the guards and escape. Now Samson is an absolute monster of a dog, and would serve well as a final villian. It would be even cooler if what stopped Samson and Camille from taking over the world was a conversation with the depressed pastor, where he convinces them that ambition is worthless, and taking over the world (etc.) is just not worth it.

TODO: we need to develop camille's father more
TODO: at some point, Camille needs to find her mother again
TODO: how to develop and humanize EVERYBODY in the story? no villians

TODO: michael's plot?

TODO: rewrite the story beats from scratch a few more times

TODO: the ending is pretty unsatisfying so far

TODO: nancy: meat as beauty
TODO: samson: meat as intelligence
TODO: camille: meat as strength
TODO: michael: meat as physics

TODO: michael: abandons vegetarianism because it's just lab-grown meat. and then women can be pastors because we're made of the same meat. and fucking is just slapping meat. and jesus was just a meat myth. and then nihilism because everything is the same old meat.

TODO: consider making michael a childhood friend of camille. he always thought camille's mom was hot.

TODO: this story desparately needs some cannibalism!! maybe make a side-effect of the super-serum a desire for human flesh?

TODO: the older man boning nancy should be super charming and charismatic

TODO:  Samson learns to be the master of his own mind by not "feeding it". He takes control of his awareness by tuning into his insticts rather than overanalyzing everything as he did in the past.

Chronological story beats:
- TODO: We need some hunting incident or butchery for Nancy to experience meat and guts as a non-issue.
- She falls in love with a boy from town. He can't flee with her to California because ______ (maybe his family is poor and he needs to help support them?).
- After seeing how beautiful one of the family horses erupts out of its cage, she too runs off to California to pursue her a career of dancing.
- She's only 17 (she lies about her age), and has no money, and homeless. She dances on the street for cash. As a homeless street performer, you experience a weird mix of being watched, being seen, and being ignored. She also notices that the apartments seem like chicken coops.
- An older man notices her, and she starts fucking him for food and rent. He treats her well, and overall, the whole situation makes her feel like a cow putting her body to good use.
- While he works in the day, she pursues her dancing career. She finds that she can't move up the career ladder without fucking agents/managers/etc. She wants them to use her body for money, but not USE her body for money. The older gentleman makes her feel like a horse/companion, but the men in the dance industry make her feel like prey/food. Her career is halted because she refuses to prostitute her body outside her own terms.
- She writes letters to her lover back home. He comes out and surprises her with a visit to the address he's been sending letters to. They bone while the man is away from his work trip. When the man comes home, the lover finds out about the arrangement, and leaves furiously.
- Her lover gets her pregnant, and the older man stops fucking her while continuing to care for her. 
- The older man dies and leaves a small fortune for her. She tells her lover that she's pregnant and that the old man left her some money.
- Her baby is born very prematurely, and she names her Camille. 
- He comes back out to Cali to help be a parent. But she slowly discovers that he's using her for her money and for her body, and kicks him out.
- Camille is weak and sickly, but a little genius, and Nancy encourages her to skip grades and participate in mathematics competitions.
- While Camille is at school, Nancy starts pursuing her dance career again. Because she's doing it for fun now, and is an empowered woman, she actually starts gaining some traction, but she falls and injures her knees.
- Nancy and Camille move back to the farm in the midwest to be with the family. Nancy needs help taking care of Camille while she's in a wheelchair for a while. Being on the farm is what makes Camille fall in love with biology and ultimately pursue a career in meat research.
- Camille's father comes around often trying to see Camille, but Nancy wants none of it. At some point, he attempts to kidnap her and she shoots and kills him with a shotgun (tie this into her hunting experiences as a child). Maybe she injures Camille with a stray bullet? Camille collects crime-scene evidence, (DNA and stuff) which she uses to prove her mother's innocence once DNA technology becomes viable (40 years later).
- Nancy gets wrongly convicted of murder, and is sentenced to life in prison.
- Camille drops out of school and spends years caring for her grandparents, tending to the farm, visiting her mom in prison, and pursuing independent experiments.
- At age 14, Camille anonymously starts publishing research on lab-grown meat production. The meat industry discovers who she is, and sends hitmen after her, who kill her grandparents in an attempt to kill her. She flees.
- She checks herself into a hospital for injuries (from the hitmen), and they ask her questions. She tells them that the meat industry is trying to kill her and they send her to a mental hospital.
- Samson awakes in a dirty cell, and he must not let the guards know anything is different. They occasionally come by and do incentives puzzles to test his intelligence. AKA they make the inmates do puzzles for better food. He purposely fails the tests.
- From the intelligence tests, Samson learns to understand English over the course of a few years.
- This particular mental hospital is filled with many "lost people" on the fringes of society. People with no family and no homes and no sanity. She discovers that she's trapped there, and they start experimenting on her. What's weird to her, is that everbody likes it there except her. All the patients are taken care of exceptionally well, and they're better off than they were back on the streets.
- Camille starts making friends with the experimenters, and helps them perfect the super-soldier serum. The researchers heal her chronic illnesses, and she becomes extremely strong and agile.
- Samson breaks out by undoing his muzzle and massacring all the examiners. He feels conflicted about acting as a beast rather than outsmarting them. On his way out, he notices Camille in a hallway. Note that the human patients are not put in cells like the animals.
- Camille is heartbroken that her only friends are dead. They were the only people she ever knew as friends.
- Samson is free, but he can't stop thinking about the little girl. He knew that they were both intelligent beasts confined against their will. He hatches a plan to break her out.
- Meanwhile, every day, Nancy dances in her prison cell, like a caged bird.
- Samson devises a plan to break Camille and everybody out of the facility.
- Samson successfully breaks Camille out of prison, but all of the inmates are killed. And most of the guards.
- To treat Samson's wounds, Camille administers the super-serum.
- Camille and Samson go into hiding. They discover that Samson killed her researcher friends, and she struggles with that resentment.
- Nancy is released early on parole. She goes from caged bird to empty nest.
- Samson is a loyal dog, and feels the need to continue helping Camille. They track down the meat mob assassins and take them out one-by-one.
- After years of planning, they finally kill the leader of the meat mob. Camille feels empty, beacuse she feels like it would've better to spend time researching (using her brain) than killing (using her body).
- Nancy is lonely, so she enters herself into a nursing home, and meets Michael.
- She and Michael start having conversations, where she's trying to convert him from Christianity. Eventually they start fucking. Nancy has been so lonely for so long, and their relationship is actually the only thing good she has going for her.
- Nancy dies while Michael is face-fucking her. This sends Michael into a depressive spiral.
- In his depression, Michael talks Samson and Camille out of their plot to overthrow the government. What's the point?
