<!--

- story about fragile situations hanging by a thread
  - all of these ticking-time bombs are slowly put into place throughout the story
    - eg a poisoned bottle of wine sitting for years in a rulers' cabinet
  - everything must look fine on the surface
  - the story is not about kinetic energy, but potential energy
  - it's abruptchaos!

Coming soon!
