- For people with space but no tiny-farm, hire local specialists to build the tiny farm.
  - Offer subspecialties like honeybees, cattle, and vertical gardening.
  - The specialists are like contractors, and they pay the app commission for all their sales.
  - Also offer services for hourly workers to tend to the tiny-farm.
- For people with tiny-farms, list it on the app.
  - When goods are ripe, list the approximate yield on the app with pictures.
  - Every morning, the app asks tiny-farmers their pickup window, available yield, and market price.
  - Tiny-farms must perform their check-in before 10AM.
  - Delivery drivers will collect the goods in the afternoon, and then deliver the goods in the evening.
  - Also allow tiny-farms to list non-food trinkets like pots and crafts and things that you'd find at a farmers' market.
  - Also list florists!
  - Drivers must also check-in before 10AM every day.
- For people who want locally-sourced food, order it on the app.

In short:
- Hire specialists to build tiny-farms.
- Tiny-farmers list their goods before 10AM every morning.
- Buyers can place orders until noon.
- Deliveries occur from 1PM-9PM.

Big problem:
- There may not be any delivery people in the area.
- For all buyers and sellers, list a message saying "There are no registered delivery drivers in your area! You and your friends could earn $100 per day by delivering fresh goods!"
- In the "earn money" section, list average hourly earnings for specialists, tiny-farmers, and drivers.
