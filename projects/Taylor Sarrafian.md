I want to be my Optimal self. But I have _no h*ckin' idea_ how.

I'm not very good at teaching myself how to be Optimal, because I don't know what Optimal Taylor Sarrafian looks like.
And I'm not very good at listening to myself, because I'm non-Optimal.
What a catch-22!

So I categorized [myself](/essays/Who the H*ck is Taylor Sarrafian?) under [projects](/projects), because, well, I have some vague ideas on how to be slightly better.

## Why

> "Rascality, pure rascality."

All life behaves according to values. They may not act in accord with their _ideal_ values, but they're values nonetheless.

In theory, my values are compassion and honesty. In an Optimal world, I would ooze empathy and kindness and give myself completely to every stranger that strikes up a conversation. But I'm not Optimal. I'm often stubborn and manipulative and full of self-criticism.

<!-- TODO: sidenote for why i care about honesty -->

<!-- TODO: sidenote for why i care about compassion -->

In practice, my values are unclear. Looking at how I spend my money, I value housing, food, music, technology, and experiences. Looking at how I spend my [time](/essays/Time), I value laughter, learning, storytelling, and making things. Looking at how I treat others, I value smiles, openness, and disruption.

### An Ideal Minute

At each moment, my Optimal self would be completely engaged in whatever I'm doing. 

No stress. 

No effort.

Wouldn't that be nice?


### An Ideal Hour

By the hour, Optimal Tay would always do the Right Thing™ at the Right Time™.

First I would _find_ the Right Thing™ to do. Efficiency doesn't matter when you're headed in the wrong direction. 

And there are often a few Right Things™ to do, so I would prioritize by finding the Right Time™. What deserves my "_now_"?

Once I found the Right Thing™ for the moment, I would focus on it until completion. Distractions are costly.

### An Ideal Month

In an ideal month, my Optimal self would connect, learn, and create.

I'd love to meet interesting people. I'd love to laugh with friends until my face hurts. I'd love to make people feel special. I'd love to rekindle dying relationships. I'd love to send hand-written thank-you letters.

Changes in knowledge are visible at the month-scale. I'd love to see myself progress on a giant deck of flash-cards as the weeks go by. And also watch myself practice, practice, practice — to have a new recipe or song or sleight-of-hand mastered every few weeks.


### An Ideal Year
