AirBNB garages (and households without cars) are wasted space.
People should be able to lease entire garages for storage.
Create a special cellular garage door opener that can be opened from the app.

Also provide an integrated moving service!
Moving companies and people with trucks should be able to provide deliveries.

Also integrate the delivery with pickup services like Craigslist.
Also integrate with FedEx, Instacart, Amazon, Postmates, etc. if possible.

Also provide standardized "pods" for self-storage.
Make multiple pod sizes that can be stacked.
The "standard" pod size should be able to fit into a pickup truck.
Also sell a lifting mechanism that can lift the pods into pickup trucks and vans.
Alternatively, long skinny boxes can be tilted and easily slid into truck beds.

> PODS storage unit prices start at $149/month.
> Delivery and pick-up fees average $74.99.
> In most cases, delivery and pick-up charges can be waived depending on the duration of your container rental.
> Keep reading to learn more about PODS' costs, discounts, and ways to cut storage costs.

Organizing garage space will become a problem, so provide shelves that the pods can fit into.
Providing pod "slots" also helps track how much space is available.
Consider making rolling "library" shelves.
Alternatively, make moving/storing costs dependent upon how difficult it is to obtain the pod, i.e. pods at the back cost more to retrieve.
