## "Flash" To-Do Cards

### 2018/10/06 1208h

I'd like to learn Japanese, but it'll be difficult to do with physical cards.

I need to finish my todo-list/flash-card app.

Lately I've been writing down all my tasks on flash cards.

It's quite nice!

Every morning I shuffle the cards and try to get through a few.

For every card, I either (1) do it or (2) split it up into more cards.

For things that I want to do every once-and-a-while, I stick it back in the pile and wait for it to show up again.

Eventually, I'm going to start mixing actual flash cards in there too, so that I can harness the power of spaced-repetition (check out Gwern's awesome write up about it).
