## Metadidact

A guide to everything!

<!--

  - [ ] A book on how everything “important” works.
    - How is everything connected?
    - Consider starting from practical things like eating, farming and getting all the way down in the physics from there.
    - Maybe the entire thing can be an instructional guide on how to eat an apple or something, with details about the neurochemistry of hunger, to farming, to nuclear sunshine?
    - I actually think the “metadidact” idea is better. Write little weird stories/situations/riddles/poems that implicitly teach how things work. Using a vague timeline of history of the universe would be a great way to cover and connect everything.
