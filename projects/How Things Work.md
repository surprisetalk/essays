Consider breaking everything up into questions and answers, so that students can use it for self-study by covering up the answers, e.g. "What is biology? The study of chemical replicators."

For each section, I think we should break it down into:
- Theory: what mental models do you use to inspect the phenomenon? (e.g. biology is chemical replicators)
- Practice: what is it like in the real world? (e.g. bilateral symmetry)
- Tools: how do you investigate? (e.g. populaton statistics)


# Philosophy

TODO


# Math

- Mathematics is the "rules of rules".
  - How do rules interact with each other? What rules can you make?
    - The study of how rules interact is called logic.
      - TODO
    - The study of what rules you can make is best viewed through model theory (or category theory?).
    
# Computation

- The study of the application of rules is called computation.
  - TODO

# Physics

TODO: physics is study of the rules of the nature, or how the universe computes itself
TODO: dimensional analysis


# Chemistry

- Chemistry is the study of emergent properties of atoms.
  - TODO


# Biology

- Biology is the study of chemical replicators.
  - Imperfect replicators adapt to their environments (evolution).
    - <genetic information; tier zoo "evolution ponits"; sexual and asexual production>
  - Replication requires materials and energy. In different contexts, the same chemicals are used and reused for material or energy (e.g. human fat is used as a material or energy, depending on the context). The Roche biochemical pathway chart illustrates all of the core conversions between material and energy from inside and outside the system.
    - Materials: All Earth's replicators are made primarily of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen, because the Earth is primarily made of these elements. Over time, more exotic replicators have learned to exploit properties of less common elements to replicate more.
      - <why chemical properties (carbon's bonds, oxygenation, etc.) make them obvious for their roles in replicators. what are important chemicals?>
        - <why are proteins, fats, and carbs used for building materials? what do they do?>
      - All these chemicals are found naturally on Earth in gaseous form as CO2, ... and in liquid form as H20, ...
    - Energy: Earth's replicators mainly get energy from (1) Sun's radiaton ("photosynthesis") and (2) chemical reactions ("eating"). Replicators store energy in chemical bonds.
      - Photosynthesis: plants need carbon to grow, so they knock the O2 off of the CO2 using the momentum from photons radiating from the sun.
        - <how do plants store energy as sugars?>
        - <why does the sun radiate photons? fusion!>
      - <eating: the main types of dietary energy are carbs, proteins, fats. all of these happen to be energy storage chemicals>


# Cognitive Science

- Groups of neurons are able to compute at an emergent level. They do this by firing together and wiring together, which creates "analogies" of the inputs. Cognitive science is the study of "analogy engines".

      
# Psychology

- Psychology is the study of human behavior, or the emergent properties of neurons in the human architecture.
  - TODO
  
TODO: neurons that fire together are wired together. we can make neurons fire together by positive/negative reinforcement/punishment.


# Sociology

- Sociology is the study of emergent psychology.
  - TODO


# Economics

- Economics is the study of value at the socialogical level.
