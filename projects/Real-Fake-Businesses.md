It's hard to even describe what I want to do here.

I feel like there's a bunch of weird contracting/consulting opportunities for niche things that I really enjoy doing! Why aren't there any "automation consultants" or "functional-programming trainers"? I could totally do it! I just need to spin up some websites and an LLC. I don't know what to do, but I'll log my progress here.
