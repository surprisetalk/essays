Just making a note here that it would be really cool to make a "skull garden".

There's something so metal about growing plants in animal skulls! Like, it seems so natural. Especially shrooms and carnivorous plants.

I'm surprised that more software-engineers don't take an interest in gardening!

Growing software and plants are pretty much the same thing:
- read the plant's spec sheet
- fight bugs
- give the plant occasional attention
- don't overdo it

And so, I'm going to plant a container garden!

Here are the things I'm interested in growing:
- mushrooms
- swamp
- useful
- bonsai
- carnivorous
- orchids
- underwater
- vines
- desert
- fuzzy

Next steps:
- mycology
- make a wish-list
