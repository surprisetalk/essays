I've got a rad video-game idea!

I'll try to track the design and development process here!

Blockchain Pokémon-like NFTs
Battle, trade, breed, feed? Accessories and items?
They exist whether you interact with them or not
Can they die in battle?
You own them, and can play with them in any game!! They can be with you in Minecraft, card games, etc

I think it would be cool if every eth address automatically starts out with 10 random ones, and people can trade them or whatever.

Holy crap
It would be cool if you could be a gym leader
You would “stake” your team in the gym like Pokemon Go?
