There's obviously some link between the entropy of a string (specifically negative multivariate mutual information), its computational complexity, and the chaos of the system that "computes".

Like, it seems pretty natural that "unpredictable" systems like turbulence and weather are also things that are hard to compute. It may seem redundant or obvious, but well, a beautiful picture is starting to emerge in my mind.
