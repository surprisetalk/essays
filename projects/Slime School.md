online school program

diplomas should be impressive on their own, and also confer high-school diplomas
- it would be amazing to have 5-star Slime Certification on par with ivy-league diplomas

lessons, quizzes, and spaced-repetition all placed on the same "stack" of cards, which grow with you over time

TODO: https://dr-stone.fandom.com/wiki/Inventions_and_Discoveries

TODO: do more things "from scratch"

TODO: write computer programs for a lot of things

TODO: get inspiration from wolfram

TODO: rather than memorization, build machinery to measure experimental results
TODO: - example: experimentally measure speed of sound with microphone and speaker built from scratch
TODO: - example: experimentally measure the distance of a US state

A very important part of the curriculum is figuring out how to get people to give you things. Where do you find clay from the ground? You have to ask to dig in somebody's back yard! Bartering/negotiation/sales with strangers is an essential part of this lesson plan.

Students must also pay for all their own materials. They must figure out how to get the money.

TODO: Combine lots of these into larger multi-stage projects.
TODO: Define clearer goals. Rather than "make a flute", do "play Bach's BWV 1013 on a handmade flute"

TODO: Make more tasks to write computer programs to explain/simulate things.
