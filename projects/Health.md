So I know I want to try out the Wim Hof breathing exercises and cold showers, but how am I going to remember? When am I going to do them?

Here are some rules I'll set for myself: I'll do cold showers until the end of the month. And then it's ice-baths on all the days I don't lift. So every day of October, it's either ice-bath or strength-training.

So then, what about breathing exercises? When trying to start a new habit, it's easier to piggyback on other things, so I guess I'll stick it to reading the news, which I usually do in the mornings and evenings.

Cool!

One day, I intend to collect bodily data, but I don't think I'm ready for that yet.

I want to experiment with the [Wim Hof Method](https://edlatimore.com/wim-hof-method-review/) and ice-baths!

I've been listening to [The Tim Ferriss Show](https://tim.blog/podcast/) for a while, and breathing and cold stuff has been on my radar for a while.

Here's a recap of the Wim Hof method ():
1. Get comfy.
2. Take 30 heavy/deep breaths (like blowing a balloon).
3. Inhale as much as possible without force.
4. Exhale as much as possible without force. Hold until you experience a gasp reflex.
6. Inhale to full capacity and hold for 10 seconds.
7. Repeat steps 1-6 two or three more times.

[There's also an app for that](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wim-hof-method/id890471578?mt=8).

Maybe I'll just buy his course and do a review. Maybe.

I want to write about biohacking experiments and fitness here!

I have so many things I want to do with nootropics and hormesis. Let's see what happens!
