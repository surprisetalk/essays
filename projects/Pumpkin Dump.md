<!--- So my current idea is to create a token with an ERC20 interface. You can pay the contract ETH to mint tokens. But the amount of tokens that are minted are variable. You can also pay the contract PUMP to get your ETH back. You can also put a backdoor on this system to turn it into an equity store. ---->

Coming soon!
