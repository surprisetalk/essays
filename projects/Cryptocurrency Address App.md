Coming soon!

<!--

create a semantic layer on top of wallets

- a lot like a portfolio tracker

- no need to add private key

- associate a username/profile with a public address

- group wallets as "my wallets" and "others' wallets" and label where they exist
- see entire account from all cryptos in one place

- recursively label each address as "me" or "friend"

- keep track of smart contracts and names of smart contracts

- "semantic transaction" tracker like "changelly"

- taxes

- defi
