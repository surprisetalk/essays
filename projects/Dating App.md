  - reviews
    - reviews do not appear until one party ends relationship
      - you are put into "ghost-mode" (messages go into the void) if other party ends relationship
        - you can't know the other person ghosted-you, otherwise you may leave a retaliatory bad review
          - in "meeting" stage, relationships automatically end after 1 week and must be renewed
            - this is so that relationships can end automatically withouut the other party knowing that they've been ghosted
    - you can reply to reviews (to defend yourself), but no replies to replies
    - each profile has reviews-written and reviews-received
    - review
      - "105 people found this review helpful"
      - tags like "catfish", "good-in-bed", "creepy", "agressive", "rude", "boring", "know-it-all", "unwanted dick-pic", "charming", "bad conversation" etc.
        - we can aggregate all the tags into one-spot with counts
      - "40min video-chats; 4 dates; 30 messages sent"
